      <p>This study will look at the effect of rotation on a 1m high 1m diameter open top container which is half filled with water.</p>

      <summary>2.1 Geometry</summary>
      <p>Geometry modeled in ANSYS Spaceclaim by pulling a 1 meter diameter circle sketch to 1m in height. The 2 fluid zones were split using a plane passing at z = 0.5m
      so that fluent can fill half the container with water later in the simulation.</p>

    <summary>3. Results</summary>
    <details>
      <summary>3.1 40 RPM</summary>
      <p>Water begins to circulate with low angular velocity leading to a slight parabolic shape.</p>

      </div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>3.2 65 RPM</summary>
      <p>As the speed approaches the calculated value of 85rpm from section 1.2, peak water height increases alongside the trough depth.</p>

        <img src="assets/65RPM.jpg" alt="65 RPM Result" />
      </div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>3.3 80 RPM</summary>
      <p>The water should begin to reach the edges of the container around 85rpm (see section 1.2). However
      due to various errors in the model (see section 4) and various assumptions in the hand calculations (section 1.2),
      the actual rpm value which would result in overflow should be higher than the hand calculated value. </p>

      </div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>3.4 100 RPM</summary>
      <p>Running the calculation at 100rpm resulted in water becoming even closer to overflow. It is noted that the water does not
      reach the top of the container at this rpm. This indicates that the assumptions in the CFD model do not hold near the boundary between 
      the container and the outlet(top), resulting in skewed results as the rpm is increased. More details on errors are discussed in section 4.</p>

        <summary>2.3 Fluent Solver</summary>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Model:</b><br>
          Use multiphase modeling with air as primary material, add liquid water from fluent database.<br>
          Standard k-eplison model with EWT and default turblence settings.<br>
          <br>
          Use MRF to model barrel motion in steady state.<br>
          Set the Air_Domain and Water_Domain to <b>frame motion</b> at the desired rpm around the z-axis.<br>
          Ensure gravity is turned on and it -9.81m/s^2 in the -z direction.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Boundry Conditions:</b><br>
          Outlet: Pressure Outet, 0 gauge pressure, defult gauge pressure in operating conditions.<br>
          Wall: No motion relative to adjacent cell zone (this means the wall <b>is</b> moving relative to absolute frame.<br>
          <br>
          Use default fluent methods (coupled scheme, PRESTO! pressure model with second order momentum)<br>
          <br>
          <b>Initilization:</b><br>
          Standard initialization from all zones.<br>
          <b>Patch</b> the water domain with 100% (volume fraction) of water.<br>
          <br>
          Run the calculation for as many iterations until convergance. <b>NOTE:</b> Often the solution does not reach convergance criteria, possible source of error.

    <!-- Errors -->
    <details>
      <summary>4. Errors</summary>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Various errors can lead to inconsistant results compared to hand calculations. Also, it is important to note that both the solver and hand calculations made assumptions towards the fdluid behaivor.
        For instance, hand calculations assumed a lack of turblence (no radial or vertical velocity component), while fluent used a k-e standard turblence model.
        <br>
        Various errors in the fluent model include:<br>
        Viscous effects neglected which impact the results at high rpm (i.e when the water reaches the surface).<br>
        Discretization error, particularly at wall bouundries where the no slip condition drives the rotational motion of the water.<br>
        Different turbulence models can impact the results of the solution.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Further Study:</b><br>
        Solution had trouble converging below the defult residules of 1e-3. In particular, continuity only converged to 1.2173e-01. The nature of the simulation is unique however since no water
        should be entering/exiting the container at low rpm. The residual plot for the simulation run at 80rpm is shown below.</p>

      <div class="res-image">
        <img src="assets/Dig4.jpg" alt="Res Diagram" />
      </div>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">In general, the effects of different turbulence models and solution methods/controls should be used to attempt to control the convergance. Additionally, a mesh refinment study should be conducted to test the
        accuracy of the mesh. </p>
    </details>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <details>
      <summary>5. Conclusion</summary>
      <p>The results of the simulation are consistant with what is intuitively expected, which is, the water created a parabolic arc that increased in depth as the wall speed was run faster.
        The water started to approach the edge at 80-100 rpm. This is relativly consistant with the hand calculated result of 85rpm. It is logical that the real result should be greater thanm the hand calculated due to the turbulence
        employed in the CFD model which intropduces slight radial and vertical velocity components. Finally, the continuity error in the simulation only droped to 1.2173e-01 which is far above the convergance criteria of 1e-3.
        Therefore, the solution methods and controls, alongside vareious turbulence models and the mesh, should be adjusted to fine tune the results in a more extensive simulation.

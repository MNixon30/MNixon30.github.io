        <summary>1.1 Problem</summary>
        <p>2 Fluids, water and oil are passed through a t-junction with mixing slots indented within the pipe. This simulation aims to determine how well theses substances mix over time (transient). 
        An external shaking acceleration will also be added (for fun) using UDF's to see how shaking of the juction can effect mixing while the fluids are flowing.</p>

        <summary>3.2 Result 2 - Increase Mixer Size - No Sloshing</summary>
        <p>From result 1, it is clear the mixing 'dents' in the pipe are not sufficient to mix the fluids, therefore, bigger, and more, indents will be added to see the effect on mixing.</p>

        <summary>3.3 Result 3 - Slight Acceleration</summary>
        <p>The effect of acceleration on the fluid flow will now be analysed. The acceleration is modeled using named expressions in Fluent, and placed under gravioty to simulate its effects. The acceleration was only modeled in the x-direction and followed the expression 
        a(t) = -0.219sin(2pi/3 * t).
        With this acceleration, it takes approx 3 seconds for a complete cycle (sloshing) to occur. However, due to computational limitations, the simulation was only run for 0.5 seconds.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <details>
      <summary>5. Conclusion</summary>
      <p>The results of the simulation indicated that the mixing of water and oil in a t-junction pipe is difficult due to the density differences and surface tensions between the substances.
      Even after changing the pipe geometry and providing external acceleration the results did not significantly change. Further studies should try different junctions, 
        pipe patterns and rotational accelerations to determine if that helps in the mixing process.</p>
